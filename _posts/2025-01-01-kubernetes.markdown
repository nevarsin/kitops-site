I am a Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Security specialist.

I can manage selfhosted/baremetal clusters as well as cloud offerings, especially AKS and EKS. Bells and whistles like Policies and Observability? Check.

I can take applications, design proper infrastructure and deploy them as scalable as needed. Dare to bring Windows nodes into the equation? No problem.

I've been working with several sizes of Linux environments for more than 20 years, therefore I can help you pinpoint issues from wrong API resources down to suspicious syscalls on that single node.

Among the tools, apps and distributions I'm most familiar with:
- ArgoCD
- Helm
- Ansible
- Crossplane
- Kyverno
- K3S
- Vault/OpenBao
- Terraform/OpenTofu
- Grafana and Prometheus stack
- Loki
- Gitlab
- Falco
