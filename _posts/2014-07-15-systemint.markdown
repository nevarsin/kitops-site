I use Python to integrate systems, automate workflows, and deliver practical backend solutions.

Across several projects, I’ve connected customer CRM platforms—such as Salesforce and SugarCRM to extract, transform, and serve data in ways that improve internal operations and user experience.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable and observable code, enabling reliable communication between services and platforms.

- Python
- Bash
- Django
- Flask
