I can help you plan your next move to the cloud, especially on Azure and AWS, with common sense.

Cloud is not just moving Virtual Machines on someone else's computers, I build, secure, and automate cloud environments with a focus on infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD workflows.

My experience includes provisioning resources on platforms like Azure, AWS, OVH and more, setting up VPCs, IAM, and monitoring pipelines.

All of this while following DevSecOps practices to ensure secure, scalable and observable systems.

Some tools I've worked with:
- Azure EntraID
- Azure Storage, VMSS, DBs
- Gitlab CI/CD
- Teamcity
- Ansible
- Terraform
- Selfhosted Atlassian Jira and Confluence
