I installed my first Linux distribution in 1997 and haven't stopped using it since.

I can take care of Linux based system administration on a wide variety of topics, from security hardening to data persistency, from application reliability to mere sensible management. I can go from pets (named servers) to cattle (managing hypervisor clusters).

Planning some new workload hoping you don't have to reinvent the wheel? Can do.

I've been working with several sizes of Linux environments for more than 20 years, therefore I can help you pinpoint issues from wrong API resources or VM configuration down to suspicious syscalls on that single node.

Some tools I've worked with:
- AppArmor
- Systemd
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL/MariaDB
- SQL Server
- Redis/Valkey
- Apache/Nginx
- KeyCloak
- Proxmox
- Gitlab
- Teamcity
- Docker
